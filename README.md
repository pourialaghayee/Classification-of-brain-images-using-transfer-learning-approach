# Classification-of-brain-images-using-transfer-learning-approach
In this project, we worked on brain medical images. First, we designed a network similar to the famous vgg16 network structure and performed classification work on the images. Then, using the transfer learning method, we considered the pre-trained vgg16 network and trained it ourselves. Finally, it was found that the transfer learning approach gives much better results. Finally, it is important to note that by using the Class Activation Map module, we realized that our model colored only the parts that specify the category of the photo, and the parts that do not have an effect on the type of photo category are colored the same, and this shows that the learning has taken place well after using the transfer learning approach. The result of CAM is in the following.
