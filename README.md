# Classification-of-brain-images-using-transfer-learning-approach
We worked on medical images of the brain in this project. With the transfer learning method, we used the pre-trained vgg16 network and trained it on medical images. Finally, it was determined that the transfer learning approach provided significant results. Moreover, using the Class Activation Map module, we discovered that our model colored only the parts which specify the category of the photo, while those parts that do not affect the category of the photo are colored in the same way, demonstrating that the transfer learning approach has resulted in effective learning.
